# Poker Game Java
This game was developed using javafx library for its GUI.
The game is highly scalable and perfectly object oriented. To give a brief overview of the class structure of the game, I have the table class that contains the Seat class and the Seat class contains the Player class. There are many other classes, such as the Game and the Deck classes.
The game is still not complete, the game now is running without any user interaction other the the two buttons **Run** and **Result**.

## How to Run
Follow this [link](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle) after you clone the repo, gradlew is for Mac and Linux users and gradlew.bat is for windows users. Make sure to ``` gradlew build ``` first then ``` gradlew run ``` <br>
